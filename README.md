Media Foundation workaround for Wine

Easily add Media Foundation support to a Wine prefix. Just set WINEPREFIX to a valid Wine prefix and run.

Example usage:

`WINEPREFIX="/dev/brain/wine prefixes can be anywhere/folder" ./mf-install.sh`

Steam stores Proton Wine prefixes as `<STEAM FOLDER>/steamapps/compatdata/<GAME ID>/pfx`

Optionally you can use Proton's Wine instead of your system's Wine. See the script for how.
